# data_table_extension
 Analyzing data in R and Visualizing in Tableau are great, but having them work together can be challenging. Posit has been working on resolving this problem and have a package known as shinytableau. With this Package we are able to build Tableau Extensions utilizing Shiny Apps built through R. We can utilize and configure R visualizations using Tableau and you can attach your own Shiny Application inside a Tableau Dashboard for added security. Please visit their site to learn more about the potential of this type of development.

In this project we are using ShinyTableau to build a Tableau Extension that uses the datatable visualization. This visualization will provide a specific table for the data provided by Tableau that can be directly viewed, copied, and downloaded in many forms.

We have hosted this application utilizing Shinyapps.io for everyone to use and try for themselves.
